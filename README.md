# Ultimate_Inc_challenge
Ultimate Inc is a ride sharing and cab booking service. They are trying to analyse which factors affect customer adoption, with a take-home challenge.

In this project, I explore the customer data and their effect on retention. I have used plots to show relationships. I also build a basic classification model to predict 
retention after 6 months of joining.
